## SVD

This repository contains a project, which was developed as a part of the "Algebra in Data Science" course during second term (summer 2023/2024) of Data Science studies at WUT.

In this project, we analyze the applications of **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**. We begin by exploring the SVD decomposition of a matrix and discuss its significant properties and the process of approximating matrices using lower ranks. We also apply SVD to image compression and demonstrate how reducing the rank can effectively approximate the original image with minimal loss of detail.
  
### Applications:
- **Image Compression**: We applied SVD to real images (models: Kluska, Stefan, Kopytko, and Prążek) to demonstrate how rank reduction can achieve significant compression while retaining visual quality.
- **Data Efficiency**: We analyze the memory efficiency of approximations by comparing the size of reduced matrices to the original ones.

The repository includes Python code for SVD implementation and visualizations, along with a report in Polish detailing the theoretical background and practical applications.
